      <div class="info">Hello, My name is Su Kim, and I'm the Campus Director at our new <a href="http://dc.theironyard.com/">DC/Arlington campus.</a> I’m coming to The Iron Yard after years of policy advocacy in human rights and immigration reform. My passions are people and removing barriers that stand in the way of people being the best they are. I’m excited to see how we at The Iron Yard can showcase the best of technology through passionate, driven, creative, and well-equipped individuals that go on to tackle the world’s problems or to realize an amazing idea.</div>
